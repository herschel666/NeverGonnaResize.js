NeverGonnaResize.js
=====

This is a small `AudioContext`-experiment, playing tasteful music while a visitor is resizing the browser-window, hunting down your media-queries. Unfortunately it only works in Chrome, though the `AudioContext` has actually a wider support.

### [Visit the demo …](http://herschel666.github.io/NeverGonnaResize.js)

… and resize the hell out of your browser-window to see what I'm talking about.

## Usage

Put the script-file into your website and initialize **NeverGonnaResize.js**:

	<script src="./path/to/never-gonna-resize.js"></script>
	<script>
		neverGonnaResize('../path/to/tasteful-music.mp3');
	</script>

That's it!
